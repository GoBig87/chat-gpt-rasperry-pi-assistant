## Step 1
Remove the screws on the back side of the Billy Bass fish and remove the AA batteries.  Open the fish cautiously and be mindful of the attached cables.

## Step 2
Disconnect the cables attached to the circuit board.  Remove the screws that hold the circuit board in place and discard it.  After removing the ciruit board, use a small dremel or similar cutting wheel to remove the plastic standoffs to create more space inside of the fish.

## Step 3
Remove the motion sensor and activation button by unscrewing the screws that hold them into place.  

## Step 4 
Allong the the top side there are plastic flares that will need to be removed in order to fit the raspberry pi.  With a cutting tool, carefully trim the flares down making sure to not cut or damage the edges of the case.

## Step 5 
With wire strippers, trim the motor wires off of the electrical wire adapters.
